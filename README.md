I have an idea for a "chat clips" twitch extension that I think might be able to help 
all twitch streamers who also create on yt and don't want to create public vods when 
they livestream with music in the background.

### Here's what I think it should have so far:

* Saves full vod for X days for offline download
* Lists all user clips and timestamps with final vod
* Discord bot that uploads mp4 files to [#chat-clips] after chat clips them.
* (Normally I would say post an mp4 link to chat, but dmca troll bots REEE)

## INTERFACE:

`Video-player twitch extension with quickclip, clip & title buttons`

### and/or

### Chat bot with commands: 

    !adduser username
    !clip [Clip title] [Clip length in seconds, up to MAX]

    /////// suggest bot commands
    !mod username
    !unmod username
    !guestclips on/off
    !viponly`
